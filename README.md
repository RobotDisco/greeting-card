# Greetings Cards

My own take on a a web-based holiday card a la https://github.com/dxnn/holidaycrafting/

Note: I am not a front-end developer and I don't know what I'm doing.

## Usage

Find one of the contained .html files and show it in a browser via github pages: https://robot-disco.github.io/greeting-card/wintermas.html

Get whoever you want to to see it and either give them the URL or turn the screen in their direction and make them look at it.
